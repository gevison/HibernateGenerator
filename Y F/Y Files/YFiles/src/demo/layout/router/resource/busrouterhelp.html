<p>
    A bus is composed of one or several interconnected <em>hub</em> nodes and the edges that connect the regular nodes
    to the hubs. For clarity, the hubs and edges of the same bus are displayed in a common color.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>Adding new nodes</dt>
    <dd>
        Clicking at the desired location in the view creates a new regular node. Hubs are not created manually, this
        demo
        creates them automatically where edges meet.
    </dd>

    <dt>Adding new edges</dt>
    <dd>
        An edge is created by dragging the mouse from the (unselected) start node to the target node. By holding the
        Shift
        key during button press or release, it is possible the start or end an edge at another edge, respectively.
        Subsequently, colors are updated to reflect the changed bus structure and an automatic routing of the new edge
        is
        done.
    </dd>

    <dt>Removing nodes and edges</dt>
    <dd>
        Selected nodes and edges can be removed using the <code>DELETE</code> key or the corresponding icon in the tool
        bar.
        Stub paths created by a deletion are removed automatically.
    </dd>

    <dt>Routing buses</dt>
    <dd>
        The routing algorithm and its properties are available in the tool bar. Use <code>Route All</code> to calculate
        a
        new routing for all buses and <code>Route Selected</code> to route each bus in which at least one edge, one hub
        or
        one adjacent regular node is selected.
    </dd>

    <dt>Automatic routing</dt>
    <dd>
        Moving and resizing of nodes triggers an automatic routing of their connections in which the remainders of the
        affected buses are kept fixed. New connections and single-edge buses are routed automatically, too.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>Grid</dt>
    <dd>
        Affects both the editor and the routing algorithm. If enabled, a grid of the given spacing is shown in the view
        and the algorithm assigns positions on grid coordinates if possible.
    </dd>

    <dt>Snapping</dt>
    <dd>
        Specifies whether snap lines are activated.
    </dd>
</dl>
